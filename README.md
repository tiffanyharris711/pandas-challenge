We were given two datasets to create several dataframes that summarize data by school, district, student and grade.

* Observation 1

There is an obvious trend that more students across all schools have higher reading scores than they do math scores. The lowest reading average across 15 schools is 80.75 whereas the lowest math average across 15 schools is 76.63. The highest averages respectively are 84.05 and 83.84. Of the 15 schools, 7 of them have lower than a 70% pass rate for math. None of the schools have a pass rate for reading less than 79%. 

* Observation 2

Class size and intimacy of the classroom environment appears to have a direct effect on the students' learning ability. None of the Charter schools have an average in either math or reading less than 83, whereas all of the average math scores in the District schools  range between 76.63-77.28. The overall passing rates average 53.67% for District schools, but 90.43% for Charter schools. Focusing on school size, we see the medium schools (between 1000-2000 students) have the best averages for reading, math and overall. However, the smaller school size is only tenths of a percent less than the medium size average. The larger schools (between 2000-3000) have an overall passing rate of 58%.
